== Description ==

Drip (www.getdrip.com) is the easiest way to capture drive-by website visitors and 
engage with them through an email mini-course. The first step to setting up Drip is 
to install a snippet of JavaScript in the footer of your website, and this plugin makes 
that dead simple for our customers who run WordPress.

= The Drip Process =

Simply [sign up for a Drip account](https://www.getdrip.com/pricing) and install this
plugin to get started. Once installed, we place a tracking script on your site to
activate your Drip account's features.
